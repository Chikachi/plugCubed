All chat messages that you send is also sent to the socket server to act as a backup chat server.

None of the data sent to the socket server is saved.
As soon as you disconnect all your userdata is no longer existant on the socket server.

Every minute the socket server counts number of clients that are connected and saves that number for statistic purpose only.
