###Features List###
New features are being added daily, however the current list of features is as follows:
* Auto-woot : Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
* Auto-joining : Automatically re-append yourself to the DJ Waitlist once you've been moved back to the crowd
   * (Moderators can turn this off by @messaging you and using the !disable command. Useful in rooms that disallow afk - autojoining)
* User list : A dynamic list of every user in the room, color-coded based on their current vote. Green = Woot, Red =   Meh, White = No vote, Pink = Curate. Special usergroups are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat
